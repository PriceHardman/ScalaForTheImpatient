/*
Scala lets you multiply a string with a
numberâ€”try out "crazy" * 3 in the REPL.
What does this operation do? Where can
you find it in Scaladoc?
 */

"crazy" * 3

// In this case, multiplying a string s by an integer n
// returns a string with s duplicated n times and
// concatenated together.
// So "crazy"*3 == "crazycrazycrazy".
