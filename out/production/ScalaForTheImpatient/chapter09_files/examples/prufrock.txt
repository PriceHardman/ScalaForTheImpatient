Let us go then, you and I;
When the evening is spread out against the sky
Like a patient etherized upon a table;
Let us go through certain half-deserted streets;
The muttering retreats of restless nights in
one night cheap hotels;
And sawdust restaurants with oyster shells;
Streets that follow like a tedious argument
of insidious intent to lead you to an
whelming question;
Oh, do not ask what is it;
Let us go an make our visit.
